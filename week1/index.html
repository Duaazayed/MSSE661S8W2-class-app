    <h1> Hello World!</h1>
    <p> My name is Duaa Zayed, I studied Computer Information System at University of Jordan, after I graduated, I worked as a Web Developer for one of the IT Companies.

        During my work I was able to create websites by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL, I also worked at websites that needed to improve and maintenance by using WordPress and other websites needed to work at CodeIgniter MVC.
        
        Although it might sound like I have a good experience, I still think that I need to improve my skills and this is one of the reasons I went back to school for.</p>
